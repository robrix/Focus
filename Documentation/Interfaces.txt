Interfaces are potentially composed of other interfaces.

Map:
	#at:

Mutable map:
	Map
	#at:put:

Enumeration:
	#detect:
	#select:
	#reject:
	#fold:
	#map:
	#each:
	#reversed

Implementations of the Map interface include vectors and hash tables. Sets don’t implement Map, but vectors, hash tables, and sets all implement Enumeration (via ranges?).


Map = Interface composedOf: [
	#at:
].

MutableMap = Interface composedOf: [
	Map,
	#at:put:
].


HashTable = Object new: {
	implements: Map.
	
	#at: = (key) {
		…
	}.
}.

MutableHashTable = Object new: {
	implements: MutableMap.
	
	#at:put: = (key) {
		…
	}.
}.
